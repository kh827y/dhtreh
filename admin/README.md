This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Notifications (Admin)

Page: `app/notifications` — broadcast by channel (ALL/EMAIL/SMS/PUSH), optional segment selection, dry‑run to estimate recipients, and template preview.

Hints:

- Use variables in templates: `{{customerName}}`, `{{merchantName}}`, and custom variables from the JSON block. Variables are applied to Subject/Text/HTML preview.
- For EMAIL, Subject is required; for SMS, Text is required; for PUSH, Subject or Text is required.
- Dry‑run returns estimated recipients before actual send.
- Admin API requires `X-Admin-Key` configured on API (`ADMIN_KEY`).

Accessibility & i18n:

- Basic a11y labels are added for inputs and buttons.
- Lightweight RU/EN switch is available in the top right corner.
